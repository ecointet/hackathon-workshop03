USE A CUSTOM BUILDPACK
===============================

==== OBJECTIVE =====
Instead the default php buildpack, we are using a custom PHP buildpack (with a different PHP Version).

PHP

==== STEP 1 =======

Push the code without the BuildPack information in the manifest
(or only framework: php).
Note the PHP Version (thanks to phpinfo();).
Edit the manifest file to use a custom buildpack
Note the PHP Version
